# Package age validation
# The check-package-age script validates that newly added dependencies
# are at least 24 hours old to avoid potential issues with packages
# that have just been published.
# 
# To check package ages:
#   pnpm check:package-age
# 
# To customize the minimum age (in hours):
#   pnpm check:package-age --minimum-age=48
