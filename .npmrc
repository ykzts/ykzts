# Minimum release age for packages (in hours)
# Prevents installing packages that were published too recently
# This provides a safety layer similar to Renovate's minimumReleaseAge setting
# Renovate uses 3 days; this uses 24 hours for faster manual updates

# Exception: Next.js canary releases
# We track Next.js canary, so exclude Next.js and related packages from age checks
