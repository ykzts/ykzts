# @ykzts/schemas

Sanity CMS schema definitions for blog posts, profiles, and work portfolio content.

## Purpose

This package provides TypeScript schema definitions for Sanity CMS content types used across the ykzts monorepo. It defines the structure and validation rules for blog posts, user profiles, and portfolio work entries that power the content management system.

## Usage

The schemas are imported and used in the Sanity Studio configuration:

```typescript
import {
  localeString,
  localeText,
  post as postSchema,
  profile as profileSchema,
  work as workSchema
} from '@ykzts/schemas'

export default defineConfig({
  schema: {
    types: [localeString, localeText, postSchema, profileSchema, workSchema]
  }
})
```

### Available Schemas

#### Localization Types

- **`localeString`**: Reusable localized string type with `en` (English) and `ja` (Japanese) fields for internationalization. Can be used across multiple schemas.
- **`localeText`**: Reusable localized text type with `en` (English) and `ja` (Japanese) fields for internationalization. Can be used across multiple schemas.

#### Document Schemas

  - **name** (required): Localized string with English (`en`) and Japanese (`ja`) fields
  - **email** (required): Contact email address
