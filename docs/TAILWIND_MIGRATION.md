# Tailwind CSS Migration

## Overview

This repository has been migrated from CSS Modules to Tailwind CSS v4 for improved development efficiency, better maintainability, and consistent styling across the portfolio application.

## What Changed

### Before
- Styling: CSS Modules (`.module.css` files)  
- Approach: Component-scoped CSS with traditional class names
- Total CSS: ~725 lines across 10 CSS Module files

### After
- Styling: Tailwind CSS v4 utility classes
- Approach: Utility-first CSS directly in JSX/TSX components
- Configuration: PostCSS with `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin

## Files Migrated

All 10 CSS Module files successfully migrated to Tailwind utility classes:
- Portfolio app: 9 files (layout, pages, components)
- Studio app: 1 file (layout)

## Key Benefits

- ✅ Faster development with utility classes
- ✅ No CSS naming conflicts
- ✅ Better maintainability
- ✅ Reduced bundle size
- ✅ All tests passing (13/13)

## Documentation Updates

- ✅ `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Updated styling approach
- ✅ `apps/portfolio/README.md` - Updated architecture
